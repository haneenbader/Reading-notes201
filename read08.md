_Building Blocks_
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.


**Block-level elements**
start on a new line

**Inline elements**
flow in between surrounding text

_**Containing Elements**_
If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.


Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).


You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
