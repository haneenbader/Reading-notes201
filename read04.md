# Read: 04 - HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions

 _**Html book :Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links”**_

 **Links** are created using the element. Users can click on anything between the opening tag and the closing tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

 **Relative URLs** can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.

 **target** If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.

 **mailto**  To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address


 _**Html book :Chapter 15: “Layout”**_

 _Building Blocks_ CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

 1. Block-level elements start on a new line
 2. Inline elements flow in between surrounding text

 _Floating Elements_ Floating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box. The floated element becomes a block-level element around which other content can flow.

 _what is the Screen Sizes?_

 Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

 _why we use Page Sizes?_
 
 Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide (since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).

 _Grids_ help create professional and flexible designs. 
 
 You can include multiple CSS files in one page

 _**js book :Chapter 3 : “Functions, Methods, and Objects”**_
 **what is the Functions  ?**
 let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)

  - _Global variables_ use more memory. The browser has to remember them for as long as the web page using them is loaded.
  - _Local variables_ are only remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed.
