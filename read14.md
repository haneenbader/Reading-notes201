# Read: 14a - CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations


 New research reveals surprising truths about why some work groups thrive and others falter.:

 * if  everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well. 
 But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.

 * there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference.



 _Transform Syntax_
 The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.


 As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the **:hover**, **:focus**, **:active**, and **:target** pseudo-classes.


 There are four transition related properties in total, including: 
 1. **transition-property**

 2. **transition-duration**

 3. **transition-timing-function**

 4. **transition-delay**.


 _Animations Keyframes_

 To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @keyframes rule.
 The @keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.
